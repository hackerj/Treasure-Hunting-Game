Changes to existing Classes
    The Data class will be removed and data members and methods redistributed where logical.
    A new Event Class will be added to replace the collection of functions in events.py.
    The Game Class will be repurposed the way it was originally intended to hold one instance of the game instead of everything.
    Correct division between game instance code and GUI code will be instituted to allow for proper save and load, functionality.
    The contents of GUI.py will be moved to be methods of ViewMain.py
    
New Classes
    Timer Management will be moved to a new class that will handle any delayed function calls.
    A Mapmaster-debug.py file will be added to replace game.py as the top level program with debugging and Mapmaster.pyw will remain the top level program without debugging.
